The move has put Miran in place just in time to cast his vote at the central bank's meeting.

The FDA's public posting of the letter comes after the New York Timesobtained a copyand reported some of the details last week. Hims & Hers stock has had a volatile year, but shares are up roughly 107% in 2025. In June, the stock suffered after Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) ended its partnership with HIMS, accusing the company of ""deceptive"" marketing. HIMS is one of the top ten most shorted stocks in the US, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence Data, with some 30% of the company's shares currently sold short.

Gabriele wrote in a note to clients Monday that the buy now, pay later (BNPL) space ""has high volume growth rates"" as payments become digitized. He said that given BNPL industry growth combined with ""numerous company specific opportunities, including Klarna penetrating further into the US,"" he expects the company to outperform its peers. ""As Klarna pushes into the US they are likely to be a market share taker against current BNPL US incumbents both in Pay Later and longer duration BNPL products,"" Gabriele wrote. Klarna was up nearly 1% in midday trading as the major stock indexes reversed earlier gains. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares sank 8% Tuesday following downgrades from TD Cowen and MorningStar analysts to Hold from Buy on Monday, per Bloomberg data.

Creutz pointed to ""the speculative nature of the current [WBD stock] rally and the elevated risk profile at these levels."" Creutz said that while a Paramount Skydance offer for the company ""may come in ... we don't love the risk-reward here given the potential for WBD shares to quickly round trip to $11-$12 if the bid doesn't materialize."" Ralph Lauren (RL) shares fell more than 1% Tuesday as the fashion company gave a three year financial outlook that disappointed investors. The company said in anupdateTuesday that it sees revenue growing in the mid-single digits over the next three years.

The moves come ahead of the Federal Reserve's highly anticipated policy meeting Wednesday, when the central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates.

The benchmark S&P 500 edged less than 0.1% higher at the open, and the Nasdaq(^IXIC) rose around 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell more than 0.1%. The gains Tuesday come after the Senate confirmed President Trump's pick, Stephen Miran, as a Federal Reserve board governor and a retail sales update showed consumers staying resilient despite a weakening labor market and continued inflation. Americans just keep spending. Retail sales in August rose 0.6% from the prior month, more than the 0.2% expected and the latest sign that US consumers continue to be resilient in the face of a labor market that has shown some signs of stress. Excluding spending on cars and gas, sales rose 0.7% last month. The largest category increases were seen in spending at clothing stores and nonstore retailers — which captures e-commerce spending — suggesting a strong back-to-school shopping season. The retail sales data is not adjusted for inflation. ""Net, net, the consumer hasn’t pulled the plug on the economy yet,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, ""and until they do, growth will continue to chug along at a moderate pace that seems to defy gravity in the face of rising tariff costs and store-bought prices.""

"Stock Market Today: Investors stumped as indecisive Fed cuts rates, offers wide array of 2026 forecasts",2025-09-17 15:01:40+00:00,"This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market.To find the latestStock Market Todaythreads,click here. Happy Wednesday.This is TheStreet's Stock Market Today for Sept. 17, 2025. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog. Firstrade Trading Behavior Specialist Stephen Callahan tells me that trading volumes on their platform were up 10% today compared with yesterday as investors reacted to the Fed's rate cut, Chairman Powell's press conference, and the Dot Plot. We'll be keeping an eye on the markets over the next few days to see how investors marinate on the Fed's two cents. Until then, we'll call it a day. ComericaChief Economist Bill Adams touched on the difficulty on the central bank, especially in terms of how to balance the dual mandate: Plante Moran Financial AdvisorsChief Investment Officer Jim Baird said: Northlight Asset ManagementChief Investment Officer Chris Zaccarelli pointed out the ""cross-currents"" in today's meeting, specifically with regards to the voting by Fed Governors: William Raveis MortgageRegional Vice President Melissa Cohn offered some color on the housing market, which remains frigid in the face of higher rates: The U.S. stock market is now closed. TheDow(+0.57%) andRussell 2000(+0.44%) closed out the day in the green, while theS&P 500(-0.10%) andNasdaq(-0.33%) dipped. Yields across the front of the Treasury yield curve declined after today's Fed meeting, while yields beyond 1Y were seen higher today: The light red box shows where rates were before today's quarter-point cut.

Baidusoared to its highest point in two years as its AI business plans to build its own training chips. With the market now closed, we can take score of what stocks won and lost the most from the Fed's widely-expected shift. Looking specifically at the S&P 500, there's a few standouts. In winners today,Hologic IncHOLX andWorkdayWDAY are both up over 7%. Here's the full list of the top 20 stocks in the index today: On the flip side, home builderBuilders FirstsourceBLDR (-5.6%) andUber(-5%) were atop the list of sinkers in the S&P. Here's the 20 worst-performers today: We've touched on the Fed's wide range of expectations this afternoon. Really, the only standout Dot on the plot seems to be coming straight from the White House. One dot situated at 2.75% in 2025 is presumed to be Fed newcomer Stephen Miran, who is believed to be the sole dissenter in Wednesday's FOMC. Confirmed just in time to join the central bank for its two-day FOMC, Miran also serves on President Trump's staff as the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, introducing fresh questions about Fed independence. Independently, Miran's two cents aren't really worth a whole lot right now. 9 of the 19 Fed Governors see two cuts by years end, but nowhere near the five cuts that he's calling for. Getting there will be an exercise in patience... at least under this Fed Chair. Still, anything can happen. Next year, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to vacate his position, investors are reckoning with whether there's a world where we get to a much more accommodative policy, perhaps thanks to a new Fed Chair nominee. Stocks have been going haywire since the Fed announced its widely-expected quarter-point interest rate cut; even more so since Fed Chair Jerome Powell went on stage and began talking about the central bank's range of views. Powell said that, ""There is no risk-free path now,"" calling the current environment a ""difficult situation for policymakers,"" because of the ""tension between the two goals"" of full employment and returning inflation to the 2% target. Some highlights from Powell's speech are below. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has taken the stage. Below are some of the highlights from his speech: ** POWELL SAYS GROWTH OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS MODERATED; GDP ROSE 1.5% IN FIRST HALF OF YEAR, DOWN FROM 2.5% LAST YEAR ** MODERATION OF GROWTH REFLECTS SLOWDOWN IN CONSUMER SPENDING; BUSINESS INVESTMENT HAS PICKED UP ** ACTIVITY IN HOUSING SECTOR REMAINS WEAK ** MEDIAN PARTICIPANT EXPECTS GDP TO RISE 1.6% THIS YEAR AND 1.8% IN 2026; A TOUCH STRONGER THAN EXPECTED IN JUNE ** LOWER IMMIGRATION AND LOWER LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION AFFECT LABOR MARKET ** ""DOWNSIDE RISKS TO EMPLOYMENT HAVE RISEN,"" SAYS POWELL ** TARIFFS HAVE PUSHED UP PRICE, BUT ""A ONE TIME SHIFT IN THE PRICE LEVEL"" OR COULD BE ""PERSISTENT"" ** BALANCE OF RISKS HAS SHIFTED, RESPONDING TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS ** ""POLICY IS NOT ON A PRE-SET COURSE,"" POWELL SAYS ** POWELL SAYS THERE WAS ""LITTLE SUPPORT"" FOR 50 BASIS POINT CUT ** BLS DATA IS ""STILL GOOD ENOUGH"" TO DO JOB After an initial pop, U.S. equities sank in response to the Fed's interest rate decision, with equities falling before recovering. The reason? The embrace of growth over inflation by the FOMC. Heading into the Fed report on the half hour, theRussell 2000(+1.44%) is still going strong; so too is theDow(+0.92%). TheS&P 500(+0.02%) is back in the green after sinking back into the red briefly. And theNasdaq(-0.35%) is recovering from a steep post-print decline. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point, bringing U.S. rates to a range between 4.00% and 4.25%, citing ""downside risks"" to the labor market. The central bank's median forecast has half a point of cuts in the two remaining FOMC meetings this year, while holding space for one cut next year. However, there's a wide variance in terms of expectations for 2026 and beyond; a Fed operating with great unknowns. However, not a lot else is changing: GDP has been upgraded for the year, unemployment is seen basically unchanged, and forecasts for CPI to stay steady and close to 3%. Stocks are finally reacting to the report, with stocks breaking upward. TheDow(+1.01%) is building on its day gains, while theRussell 2000(+0.66%) is pulling back from its morning rally. TheS&P 500(+0.17%) is finally back in the green on the day. TheNasdaq Composite(-0.20%) is also made some headway after the report. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.22% now, reversing early day gains. The 2Y, 10Y, and 30Y have all declined in the initial reaction to the report. Today's cut was the first since Dec. 2024 and comes 364 days after the Fed began its current easing cycle. If you yearned for bonds at 4.25% to 4.50%, you might want to enjoy it while it lasts, i.e: the next hour. At 2:00 p.m. ET, the Fed will release its interest rate decision from its two-day FOMC meeting. And soon after, we'll get a glimpse of the Fed's refreshed Dot Plot. We'll also hear from Fed leaders at the press conference, 30 after the hour. Going into the final minutes before the print, let's take score: theRussell 2000(+0.67%) andDow(+0.44%) are up, while theS&P 500(-0.16%) andNasdaq Composite(-0.43%) are down. The10Y(+1.9 basis points) is slightly higher at 4.045%.Spot Gold(-0.07%) is down to $3,686.11 per oz, per data from goldprice.org. There's clearly some optimism, seeing the Russell 2000 today. Check out the heatmap before the big print: On the other hand, the S&P 500 isn't looking so hot; looks like megacaps are the culprit: Ticketing platformStubHubSTUB is now trading, jumping 7% in its debut. The offering raised $800 million at an $8.6 billion valuation, one of the larger offerings of 2025 thus far. Its offering comes at a time of challenges for the business, which is facing steeper competition fromTicketmaster, which has implemented a series of changes to discourse ticket reselling or fraud. Adding to the difficulties, regulators are increasingly sensitive to ticket resale. Still, StubHub has been well-acquainted with difficulty. After being purchased by eBay in 2007, the company has been a 'hot potato', being later acquired back by its cofounder at Viagogo before embarking on its journey to Wall Street. We'll have to see if the company can hold on to its day one gains in the future. Some recent IPOs have not fared well after their opening day pop, includingGeminiGEMI andKlarnaKLAR; both of which have declined from their first-day pops. We're almost over the midday hump and nearly two hours away from the Fed's big rate cut decision. Checking in on stocks (with a >$300 million+ market cap), there's been some movement in the stocks lining the top and bottom of the market ahead of this afternoon's big rodeo. Here are the top 20 stocks in the market this afternoon: And here are the bottom 20: The U.S. markets are now open, but there's not a lot going on for the moment, at least unless you're the Dow. This morning theDow(+0.40%) is the only index taking charge this morning, making inroads in spite of some negative news out of China for chipmakerNvidia(NVDA)(-1.2%), one of the index's 30 holdings. Here's how things are shaping up in the index this morning: Aside from the Dow's moves this morning, theS&P 500(+0.06%),Russell 2000(-0.09%), andNasdaq(-0.16%) are little moved this A.M. Looking at the broader market, a few stocks are making big moves out of the gate, includingRoivantROIV (+12%) andGrab HoldingsGRAB(-5.4%), the market's top and worst performer for the moment, per Yahoo Finance. However, we're just getting started for the day, so take the starting gun with a grain of salt. Here are the stocks in the green this A.M: Here are the stocks heading lower: Two big data points just dropped inHousing StartsandBuilding Permits, showing further deceleration in the housing market in August: Building Permitswere 1,312,000 (vs. 1.37 million expected) [-3.7% year-over-year] Housing Startswere 1,307,000 (vs. 1.37 million expected) [-8.5% YoY] Stocks are flat ahead of the highly-anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate announcement, which will be out at 2:30 p.m. ET. TheS&P 500(-0.07%), Nasdaq(-0.09%),Dow(+0.03%),andRussell 2000(+0.08%)are all trading fairly flat ahead of the big decision, which will include some visibility into the central bank's perspective on the timing of future cuts. There's a few data points due out today, such asBuilding Permits / Housing Starts, which will drop in short order. But most investors have already cleared their slate for the real event today this afternoon: the Fed's interest rate decision. The market anticipates a 25 basis point (0.25%) cut, but a refreshed Dot Plot will show what can be expected from the central bank over the course of the next few meetings. Here's everything on the slate for today: Per Nasdaq, there are 27 earnings reports due out today. However, there's five of real consequence to most (market cap exceeding $1 billion. Among them areGeneral MillsGIS,BullishBLSH, andManchester UnitedMANU.

"Stock market today: Nasdaq futures jump to lead Dow, S&P 500 higher after Fed signals more cuts",2025-09-18 10:24:40+00:00,"US stocks were poised on Thursday for a bid on fresh record highs, after the Federal Reservelowered interest ratesfor the first time this year and signaled that more cuts are on the way in coming months. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures(YM=F)rose 0.7%, while those on the S&P 500(ES=F)moved roughly 0.9% higher. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100(NQ=F)led the gains, up more than 1%. Stocks are eyeing new highs afterslippingfrom records in the wait for the Fed to confirm the widely anticipated shift to easing. If premarket gains hold, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) looks set to cross 6,700 at the open, afterclosing above 6,600for the first time on Monday. The moves come as Wall Street debates the future path of Fed policy. Signs of a growing slowdown in the labor market are credited with helping persuade policymakers to cut rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday. The Fed's""dot plot"" indicatedthat two more interest cuts are likely before the end of 2025. However, Chair Jerome Powell said high inflation and a weak labor market leave ""no risk-free path"", raising doubt further cuts will come smoothly. Investors will get more insight into the jobs landscape with the release of weekly jobless claims figures on Thursday. On the corporate front, FedEx (FDX) will report its quarterly results after the bell. Analysts expect the delivery giant's profit totake a hitfrom President Trump's decision to end the ""de minimus"" tariff exemption for low-value direct-to-consumer packages from China and Hong Kong. These packages account for about three-quarters of duty-free sub-$800 shipments to US each year, they said.

And two, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg playing with his new AI glasses on stage at the company's Connect event. What a way to start my reporting day! While Zuck's new tech didn't work perfectly on stage, what he showed off was impressive — especially after the dud that was Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 17 reveal. JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth agrees on Meta: Disney (DIS) stock is little changed on Thursday after the media giant's ABC network took ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" off air indefinitely, responding to a backlash over remarks on the killing of Charlie Kirk. The move followed a warning by Nexstar Media (NXST) that it would pull the late-night talk show from its network of affiliates. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr also hinted at a risk to ABC broadcast licenses if no action was taken over Kimmel's remarks around the death of Republican activist Kirk.
